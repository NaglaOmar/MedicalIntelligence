To create an agentic system that assists radiologists and physicians by intelligently processing medical images (DICOM/NIFTI), leveraging LLMs (Gemini, MedGemma), segmentation tools (TotalSegmentator), and medical AI models (MONAI), with seamless integration into clinical workflows (PACS/DICOMweb) and an intuitive web-based frontend (Cornerstone.js).
Core Principles:
Modularity: Design agents with specific, well-defined responsibilities.
Iterative Development (MVP Approach): Start with core functionality and progressively add features.
Local-First Potential (for some components): While relying on APIs like Gemini, aim for local processing where feasible for privacy and control (e.g., image processing).
Clinical Relevance: Focus on tasks that provide tangible benefits to medical professionals.
Security & Compliance: Prioritize data security and adherence to medical data regulations (HIPAA, GDPR, etc.) from the outset.
User-Centric Design: Ensure the frontend is intuitive and useful for clinicians.
Phased Development Plan:
Phase 0: Foundation & Setup
Objective: Establish the development environment, select core frameworks, and perform deep dives into key technologies.
Tasks:
Set up Python environment (e.g., 3.10+ with venv or Conda).
Install core libraries: Pydicom, NiBabel, SimpleITK, OpenCV, NumPy.
Set up accounts/API keys for Google Gemini.
Install TotalSegmentator and test it on sample data.
Explore MONAI and download a few relevant pre-trained models.
Basic Cornerstone.js setup (HTML, JS) to display and render a sample Nifti,  DICOM and images.
Research and select a backend web framework (Flask or FastAPI recommended for simplicity and performance).
Research Model Context Protocol (MCP) server setup and client interaction.
Define initial data flow and agent responsibilities on paper.
Outline security and compliance strategy.


Phase 1: MVP - Local Image Processing & Basic Display
Objective: Create a basic system that can take a DICOM/NIFTI file, perform segmentation, and display the original image and segmentation overlay in a web UI.
Core Components:
Data Handling Agent (Backend): Loads DICOM/NIFTI, converts formats if necessary.
Imaging Analysis Agent (Backend): Runs TotalSegmentator.
Basic Web UI (Frontend): Uses Cornerstone.js to display images and overlays served by the backend.
Simple API (Backend): Endpoints to upload images, trigger processing, and retrieve results for display.


Key Technologies: Python, Flask/FastAPI, Pydicom, NiBabel, TotalSegmentator (subprocess call), Cornerstone.js.
Milestone: User can upload a CT scan, see the raw scan, and see the TotalSegmentator output overlaid in a browser.
Phase 2: MVP - LLM Orchestration & Basic Interpretation
Objective: Integrate an LLM (Gemini 2.5) as the orchestrator to understand simple natural language requests and coordinate the actions of the Phase 1 agents.
Core Components:
Orchestrator Agent (Backend):
Takes user text input.
Uses Gemini API to interpret intent and extract parameters (e.g., "Segment the liver in this scan").
Optionally, routes requests through an MCP server.
Calls the appropriate backend agents (Data Handling, Imaging Analysis).


Enhanced API & UI: Allow text input for commands. Display LLM-generated text (e.g., "Segmentation complete for liver").


Key Technologies: Gemini API, (Optional) Model Context Protocol server/client, updated backend logic.
Milestone: User can type "Segment kidneys in the uploaded CT," and the system performs the segmentation and confirms.
Phase 3: Advanced Analysis & Multimodal Capabilities
Objective: Integrate more advanced AI models (MONAI, MedGemma) and enable richer interaction.
Core Components:
Imaging Analysis Agent (Enhanced):
Integrate MONAI models for tasks beyond TotalSegmentator (e.g., specific lesion detection).


Multimodal Understanding Agent (Backend):
Integrate MedGemma (or similar) to answer questions about images or generate descriptive text.


Report Generation (Basic): Orchestrator uses LLM/MedGemma to draft simple textual summaries of findings.


Key Technologies: MONAI, MedGemma API/integration, updated Orchestrator logic.
Milestone: User can ask, "Analyze this scan for liver lesions and provide a summary." The system runs segmentation, a MONAI lesion model, and MedGemma provides a textual summary.
Phase 4: PACS Integration & Workflow Enhancement
Objective: Enable the system to retrieve data from and send results back to a PACS, making it usable in a clinical setting.
Core Components:
Data Handling Agent (Enhanced - PACS Client):
Implement QIDO-RS/WADO-RS (or pynetdicom for C-FIND/C-MOVE) to retrieve studies from PACS.
Implement STOW-RS (or pynetdicom for C-STORE) to send DICOM SEG/SR objects back to PACS.


DICOM Object Creation: Logic to create DICOM SEG (segmentation) objects from TotalSegmentator/MONAI outputs and basic DICOM SR (structured reports) from LLM-generated text.


Key Technologies: DICOMweb client libraries (e.g., requests for RESTful calls) or pynetdicom, dcmqi or highdicom for creating DICOM SEG/SR.
Milestone: System can query a PACS for a patient study, retrieve it, analyze it, and store segmentation results and a summary report back to the PACS.
Phase 5: Deployment, Testing, & Iteration
Objective: Package the application, deploy it, conduct thorough testing (including with medical professionals if possible), and gather feedback for further refinement.
Tasks:
Containerization (Docker).
Deployment strategy (cloud server, on-premise).
Robust logging and monitoring.
Comprehensive unit and integration testing.
User Acceptance Testing (UAT) with target users.
Performance optimization.
Security audits and hardening.
Documentation for users and developers.
